# NASA Turbofan RUL Prediction

**Difficulty:** 7/10 &middot; **Task type:** Survival / RUL regression

This repo is one of 22 Liora MLE portfolio projects. Phase 1 scaffold (EDA + verified references + baseline + advanced model scripts + IMRaD manuscript + presentation) is complete. Model execution happens in the main learning session (not committed here).

## Repo layout

## Data

Raw data is **not committed** (see `.gitignore`). See `data/README.md` for the dataset source and exact download command.

## How to reproduce

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sandyyy123/liora-11-nasa-turbofan.git
cd liora-11-nasa-turbofan
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   # if present
# Follow data/README.md to download the dataset, then:
jupyter lab notebooks/
python src/model_baseline.py
python src/model_advanced.py
```

## Status
